Hi!

Barry Maswan - better known as *Kimi* if you knew me before I joined high school. I currently live in New York City - Brooklyn specifically but work in
Manhattan. I have very strong opinions as to why Brooklyn is THE best borough. Given the comparison of the boroughs is a very touchy subject, if you
want to know what these very strong opinions are, you'll need to buy me a beer. And drink one with me. And help me document the experience.

One of my favorite books of all time is Nudge. I try to incorporate its teachings in my daily life - setting up my environment to encourage me
to do the things I  want to do but typically end up not for a variety of reasons. Hence, this blog. I've been meaning to document my thoughts,
ideas and experiences because it'll a. improve my writing b. serve as a starting point when I'm old and need to remind myself what the hell I did
with my life c. share ideas that I think some people in the world might benefit from. The public-ness of an internet blog should hopefully force 
me to regularly do so. Here you'll find posts on programming/software, beer, piano, life and whatever else happens to fancy my interests.
